# GameOff24-SECRETS
Personal unity game project repository for github's game jam - Game Off 2024.

Submissions open from November 1st 2024 at 9:37 PM to December 1st 2024 at 10:37 PM
This year's Game Off theme is SECRETS.

## New this year: wildcards (for extra nerd cred)
"We’re introducing wildcards—optional challenges to give your games some extra flair,  inspired by Global Game Jam’s “diversifiers” and Godot Wild Jam’s “wildcards”:

* Small palette: limit your colors to 4—perfect for retro CGA vibes or Fantasy Consoles experiments.
* Cheat mode: let players break the rules with things like infinite lives or invincibility via codes, key combos, or hex edits.
* Speed run: make time the enemy! Add high scores or leaderboards, and rewards for clever, time-saving moves.

Incorporate any, all, or none into your game for an extra fun challenge!"
